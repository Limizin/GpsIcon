# GpsIcon
A Gps status icon for android.

Before Kitkat, The GPS icon in the status bar reflected whether your device was still searching for satellites or already had acquired a fix. With Kitkat, this no longer was the case – but an XPosed module named
[GPSNotification](http://repo.xposed.info/module/eun.xposed.gpsnotification) fixed that.

This module is no longer working with Lollipop – which is where ***Gps Icon*** comes into play. Thanks to this little app, you again can see the GPS status in your status bar.
